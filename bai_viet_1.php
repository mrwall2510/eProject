        <h1>Tips for choosing the right luggage for your trip</h1>
        <p>
        Whether you travel frequently or constantly for work, the type of luggage you choose can make a difference in the quality of your trip. It is important to choose luggage that is well designed and constructed to do the job of transporting your belongings efficiently during transit.</br>To achieve this, here are a few tips :
        </p>
        <h2>1. Choose the right luggage size</h2>
        <p>
        The most common rule when choosing a travel suitcase is to follow the standards of the aircraft and this is also the standard from major airlines to low-cost airlines that you need to pay attention to.
        </p>
        <ul>
                <li>Carry-on baggage for airplanes, refer to some regulations of airlines, the weight is not more than 7kg and the total dimensions of the suitcase are regulated not to exceed 115cm, specifically 56cm length x 36cm width x 23cm width.</li>
                <li>For checked baggage, each airline has its own regulations, usually converted into weight and 20kg is a relatively safe weight for many airlines.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>2. Consider your luggage weight</h2>
        <p>
        While it may seem like a paradox to have luggage that is both durable and lightweight, carry-on luggage should be lightweight so you don't have to lift a heavy, unwieldy suitcase into the overhead compartment.
        </p>
        <p>Checked baggage should also be light to avoid airlines charging extra for checked baggage. Polycarbonate hard shell material is a smart choice for lightweight luggage that is still strong and durable.</p>

        <h2>3. Flexibility</h2>
        <p>
        Luggage offers a wide range of options for business travelers, with many offering convenience and versatility. Some rolling luggage has additional straps to attach laptops, and some carry-ons have piggyback pockets on the back to attach smaller bags to the handles of luggage carts. Travelers may also want to consider hands-free carrying options, such as bags with shoulder straps. Whether you choose rolling or hands-free travel, check to see if your luggage has plenty of front, side, and interior pockets for storage. A padded laptop compartment is especially important for business travelers to help keep laptops safe while on the go.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Choose a suitcase with a secure lock to protect your belongings.</h2>
        <p>
        The locking and security system of your suitcase is also important. Modern suitcases are often equipped with security locks such as combination locks, TSA (Transportation Security Administration) locks, or fingerprint locks. This helps protect the contents of the suitcase from theft or unauthorized viewing. Make sure that the suitcase you choose has a locking and security system that suits your needs.

        <h2>5. Other factors</h2>
        <p>
        In addition to the above notes, choosing the right travel suitcase may also be related to color, warranty for the suitcase and type of handle.
        </p>
        <ul>
                <li>First of all, Bronx Luggage is currently very diligent in releasing new, diverse designs, which are extremely popular with travelers, so depending on your trip and preferences, choose your favorite color!</li>
                <li>Price is also something we consider. As mentioned above, if you want a 'long-lasting' travel suitcase for every trip, you should consider investing in a good, quality suitcase from a major brand to minimize the possibility of damage and use it not only in the short term but also in the long term throughout the journey from travel, work or moving furniture.</li>
                <li>If you rarely use it, and your needs are not high, you can buy it at a mid-range price and you won't regret it if it breaks or you want to change to a newer type. The warranty policy also needs to be prioritized, major travel suitcase brands all have product warranties, so buy from a reputable place with a good warranty policy such as 10 years, or even lifetime.</li>
